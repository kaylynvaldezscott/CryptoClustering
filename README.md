# CryptoClustering
Submitted by Kaylyn Valdez-Scott Date: 15-JAN-2024 Project Title: Module 19 Crypto Clustering Challenge

Purpose of project is to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes using unsupervised machine learning techniques. 

Assignment is broken down into 7 sections:
  1. Prepare the Data
  2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
  3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
  4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
  5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
  6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
  7. Visualize and Compare the Results

Through the assignment, I created two elbow curve graphs and two cluster plots to compare and analyze original data with new PCA data. In conclusion, I found that using the PCA data created a more organized and tighter formed pattern of clusters. By using the PCA data, I found that a best value of 2 is actually more likely, as the cluster data using PCA has more tightly formed and precise data within only 2 clusters.
